Ellipsis is a package manager for dotfiles.

### Features
- Creating new packages is trivial (any git repository is already a package).
- Modular configuration files are easier to maintain and share with others.
- Allows you to quickly see which dotfiles have been modified, and keep them
  updated and in-sync across systems.
- Adding new dotfiles to your collection can be automated with `ellipsis add`.
- Cross platform, known to work on Mac OS X, Linux, FreeBSD and even Cygwin.
- Large test suite to ensure your `$HOME` doesn't get ravaged.
- Completely customizable.
- [Works with existing dotfiles!][docs-upgrading]

### Install
**Requirements:** bash, curl, git

Clone and symlink or use handy-dandy installer:

```bash
$ curl ellipsis.sh | sh
```

<sup>...no you didn't read that wrong, [the ellipsis.sh website also doubles as the installer][installer]</sup>

You can also specify which packages to install by setting the `PACKAGES` variable, i.e.:

```bash
$ curl ellipsis.sh | PACKAGES='vim zsh' sh
```

Add `~/.ellipsis/bin` to your `$PATH` (or symlink somewhere convenient) and
start managing your dotfiles in style :)

As of version `1.7.3` you can also use the init system to automatically setup
you environment. As a bonus it will allow you to use the powerful `pkg.init`
hook to do the same for your packages.

### Usage
Ellipsis comes with no dotfiles out of the box. To install packages, use
`ellipsis install`. Packages can be specified by github-user/repo or full
ssh/git/http(s) urls:

```bash
$ ellipsis install ssh://github.com/zeekay/private.git
$ ellipsis install zeekay/vim
$ ellipsis install zsh
```

...all work. By convention `username/package` and `package` are aliases for
https://github.com/username/dot-package. (customizable using `ELLIPSIS_PREFIX`)

For full usage information you can read the [docs][docs-usage] or ask help from
the command line with the `-h` option.

### Configuration
You can customize ellipsis by exporting a few different variables:

| Variable                        | Description                                                                                                                                                          |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `GITHUB_USER` / `ELLIPSIS_USER` | Customizes whose dotfiles are installed when you `ellipsis install` without specifying user or a full repo url. Defaults to `$(git config github.user)` or `whoami`. |
| `ELLIPSIS_REPO`                 | Customize location of ellipsis repo cloned during a curl-based install. Defaults to `https://github.com/ellipsis/ellipsis`.                                          |
| `ELLIPSIS_PROTO`                | Customizes which protocol new packages are cloned with, you can specify `https`,`ssh`, `git`. Defaults to `https`.                                                   |
| `ELLIPSIS_PREFIX`               | Customizes the prefix of ellipsis configuration packages (default: `dot-`).                                                                                                            |
| `ELLIPSIS_HOME`                 | Customize which folder files are symlinked into, defaults to `$HOME`. (Mostly useful for testing)                                                                    |
| `ELLIPSIS_PATH`                 | Customize where ellipsis lives on your filesystem, defaults to `~/.ellipsis`.                                                                                        |
| `ELLIPSIS_PACKAGES`             | Customize where ellipsis installs packages on your filesystem, defaults to `~/.ellipsis/packages`.                                                                   |
| `ELLIPSIS_LOGFILE`              | Customize location of the logfile, defaults to `/tmp/ellipsis.log`.                                                                                                  |

```bash
export ELLIPSIS_USER="zeekay"
export ELLIPSIS_PROTO="ssh"
export ELLIPSIS_PATH="~/.el"
```

### Packages
A package is any repo with files you want to symlink into `$ELLIPSIS_HOME`
(typically `$HOME`). By default all of a repository's non-hidden files (read:
not beginning with a `.`) will naively be linked into place, with the exception
of a few common text files (`README`, `LICENSE`, etc).

You can customize how ellipsis interacts with your package by adding an
`ellipsis.sh` file to the root of your project. Here's an example of a complete
`ellipsis.sh` file:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
```

Yep, that's it :) If all you want to do is symlink some files into `$HOME`,
adding an `ellipsis.sh` to your package is completely optional. But what if you
need more? [That's where hooks come in...][docs-hooks]
